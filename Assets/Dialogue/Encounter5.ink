The light doesn't reach this far into the depths. Not even a single creature is visible to you as you gaze out. But you know that "its" out there. Its been watching you for so long now - and soon, it will do more than just watch.
A wave of fear and helplessness possesses your mind, as you try so fervently to deny the horrible fate awaiting you. If I just repair the ship - you try to convince yourself - if I can just do that, I'll be ok. I'll be ok right? Right!?
Its getting closer now.
Now its even closer.
Almost here...
