Finally, you're here! I thought you would never show up...
You're one of those contract workers, aren't you? Well, I guess its better than using our own men.
They briefed you on what you're doing here, right? No? Well its real simple, I promise.
A few weeks back, one of our scientists tagged a certain creature, one that, until recently, was thought to be extinct.
I can't say much else regarding said creature, but it shouldn't matter for your job anyways.
Three days ago, we found that the movement of the creature had halted at a particular deep sea location. 
All you need to do is go down there in the submarine we're providing you and retrieve the tag. It has valuable information stored on it, and we could use it.
All right, that should be all. What a pain, having to explain this like you're some new recruit...
Oh, one last thing. Every now and again the sub's system will need some maintenance. Its as simple as adjusting the water-lock so that all connections on it line up. You should probably head over and adjust it now.
All right, now hurry up! You're not getting paid to just stand around...
